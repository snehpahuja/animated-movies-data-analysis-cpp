# Animated Movies Data Analysis (C++)

## Overview
This project analyzes a large dataset of animated movies to explore patterns related to revenue, popularity, ratings, genres, production companies, countries, and languages. The analysis was implemented entirely in C++, focusing on data structures, algorithmic thinking, and analytical interpretation rather than using high-level analytics libraries.

## Project Context
Animated films are produced across multiple countries and studios, with varying budgets, runtimes, audience reach, and commercial success. This project examines how these factors relate to one another by processing raw movie metadata and applying sorting, aggregation, correlation, and frequency analysis techniques.

The project was completed as part of an academic Data Structures and Algorithms course, with an emphasis on building analytics logic from scratch.

## Scope of Analysis
The analysis covers:
- Revenue, popularity, budget, runtime, and IMDb rating relationships  
- Top production companies by total revenue  
- Country-level and language-level production patterns  
- Genre frequency distribution  
- Temporal trends in movie releases  
- Word frequency analysis of movie titles and taglines  
- Correlation and linear regression between key numerical variables  

## Key Insights
- A small number of production companies account for a large share of total revenue  
- Budget shows a positive but imperfect relationship with revenue and popularity  
- Certain countries dominate animated movie production both in volume and revenue  
- Popularity and IMDb ratings are related, but not perfectly aligned  
- Title and tagline word usage reflects recurring themes and trends over time  

## Technical Approach
- Parsed raw CSV data using custom string processing logic  
- Designed structured data models using C++ classes and structs  
- Implemented merge sort, bucket sort, binary search, and frequency counting  
- Computed correlation coefficients and linear regression parameters manually  
- Aggregated metrics across companies, countries, languages, and genres  

## Deliverables
- C++ source code implementing the full analysis pipeline  
- Console-based analytical outputs summarizing findings  
- A detailed academic report explaining data preparation, methodology, results, and interpretation  

## Detailed Report
A comprehensive report describing the dataset, algorithms, analysis steps, and conclusions is included in this repository as a PDF.
